# Marketing-Campaign-Excel-Dashboard

Status: IN PROGRESS

The goal of this project is to see how much a marketing campaign impacted consumer purchase behavior. The dataset includes information such as customer education, househould size, income, date of last purchase, date of membership enrollment, days since last purchase, how many web visits were made, and how many campaigns it took for the customer to accept the offer. 

The skills involved in this project will include data cleaning on excel and developing an easy dashboard visualization. The specific functions learned and used from previous knowledge will be linked above.
